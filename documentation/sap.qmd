# Background {#sec-background}

Natural menopause is the process by which women stop menstruating due to ovarian aging (1) typically between the ages of 40-65 years. While a natural process, menopausal women can experience a variety of physical and psychological symptoms that impact their quality of life. One such trait of menopause are vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which encompasses hot flashes and night-time awakenings secondary to hot flashes (2). VMS occurs in approximately 75-80% of menopausal women and are often considered the cardinal symptoms of menopause (3, 4).

This study is a large-scale characterization study of clinical features in menopausal women's treatment using databases mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This study uses standardized approaches and tools developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community for the OMOP CDM. This approach ensures reliable and reproducible evidence from a wide range of data from different sources. Through this study differences in the usage of prescribed menopausal medications under diverse geographical settings and medical systems within the US and the United Kingdom (UK) will be investigated.

# Research Questions {#sec-questions}

-   What are the treatment pathways (defined as the ordered sequence of medications that a woman is prescribed) of different prescription medications used to manage symptoms of menopause in a real-world setting in the US and UK?
-   What are the treatment pathways of prescribed medications used to manage VMS or sleep disturbances in women of menopausal age in a real-world setting in the US and UK?

# Objectives

## Primary Objectives {#sec-primaryObj}

The primary objectives of this study are to:

-   Describe treatment pathways and duration of treatments used to manage symptoms of menopausal women across a network of observational data.
-   Describe demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of menopausal women across a network of observational data.
-   Describe the frequency of drug utilization for treatments used to manage symptoms of menopause across a network of observational data. Further, to consider the frequency of utilization for on and off label treatments for VMS in menopausal women.
-   Describe the incidence of symptoms of menopause following menopause diagnosis across a network of observational data. These symptoms being those that women would seek treatments for management e.g VMS, sleep disturbances, vaginal dryness.

## Exploratory Objectives {#sec-exploratoryObj}

Due to known limitations in the recording of menopause diagnosis in observational healthcare databases, in addition to the primary objectives, exploratory objectives to this study will focus on women of menopausal age with 1) an index diagnosis of a menopausal symptom (VMS or sleep disturbances) and 2) an index of a prescription of HT.

For exploratory cohort 1) an index diagnosis of a menopausal symptom (VMS or sleep disturbances), the exploratory objectives are:

-   Describe treatment pathways and duration of treatments used in menopausal women across a network of observational data.
-   Describe demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of menopausal women across a network of observational data.

For exploratory cohort 2) an index of a prescription of HT, all objectives as listed under the primary objectives will be assessed.

# Study Design {#sec-design}

This large-scale retrospective cohort study will be conducted across a network of healthcare databases standardized to the OMOP CDM. Databases assessed in this study are: a) Bayer data assets (CPRD GOLD, CPRD Aurum, Optum Claims, MarketScan). The final list of databases will be provided in the Data Sources section.

The study period begins on January 1, 2009 (or earliest date of data availability after January 1, 2009) and ends at the latest date of data availability in each database. Persons involved in the study must have a minimum of one-year prior observation in the database prior to index date and 183 days post index date. The indexing period is between on January 1, 2010 and 6 months prior to the end of the study period.

The study populations for this study are the following:

1)  Natural menopausal women: women between the ages of 40 and 65 with a first diagnosis of menopause

2)  Natural menopausal women contraindicated for HT: women between the ages of 40 and 65 with a first diagnosis of menopause and with at least one record of breast cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, gynecological cancer, brain meningioma or myocardial infarction (contraindications for HT)

3)  Women with natural menopause who have a family history of breast cancer: women between the ages of 40 and 65 with a first diagnosis of menopause and a family history of breast cancer

4)  Women with or at high risk of breast cancer exposed to endocrine-adjuvant therapy: women aged 18 or above with breast cancer or those at high risk of breast cancer that initiate treatment with endocrine-adjuvant therapy

5)  Women with menopause symptoms: women between the ages of 40 and 65 with a initial diagnosis of a menopause symptom (VMS or sleep disturbances)

6)  Women with initial prescription to hormone therapy: women between the ages of 40 and 65 with a initial prescription for hormone therapy

More details for each of the study populations can be found in @sec-target.

## Exposure Definition {#sec-exposure}

In this study, there are five exposure cohorts defined by groupings of treatments used to manage symptoms of menopause. These cohorts are defined as an index exposure to one of the five treatments to manage symptoms of menopause (listed below) with 365 days of prior observation required. The exposure cohorts are followed-up until a) end of continuous observation or b) a visit occurrence at age 65 or above (indicating the end of menopause), c) end of the study period. The exposure cohort is depicted graphically in the figure below.

![Figure 7: Study Design](images/exposure_design.png)

These treatment groups are defined using the ATC hierarchy and include the descendant ingredients of the respective class. The exposures are defined as follows:

-   Hormonal Therapy (HT)
-   Antidepressants prescribed for menopausal management
-   Anticonvulsants prescribed for menopausal management
-   Anti-hypertensives prescribed for menopausal management
-   Benzodiazepines prescribed for menopausal management

## Outcome Definition {#sec-outcomes}

This study considers incidence of menopausal symptoms where the occurrence of a subsequent menopausal symptom is considered the outcome. The purpose of this part of the analysis is to contextualize the treatment patterns and utilization over time with the incidence of symptoms over time, which may cause women to change their treatment plan. This outcome only corresponds to the analysis for the primary objective where a menopause diagnosis (defined by cohorts 1-4 in section @sec-design) is the index event and exploratory cohort 2, an index of a prescription of HT (defined in section @sec-design). Symptoms to be assessed as outcomes post-index include:

-   VMS (Hot flashes and night sweats)
-   iVMS
-   Sleep Disturbances
-   Combined Mood Disorder (Depression and Anxiety)
-   Depression
-   Anxiety
-   Bipolar Disorder
-   Vaginal Dryness

# Data Sources {#sec-dataSources}

The data sources for this study include a) Bayer OMOP assets of CPRD Aurum, CPRD GOLD, Optum Claims, MarketScan and b) European databases that are part of EHDEN. All databases used in this study have been standardized to the OMOP CDM. The table below is subject to change upon confirmation of data partners.

# Analysis Plan

## Cohort Diagnostics {#sec-cd}

Prior to running any specific analysis,the four menopausal cohort definitions of the primary objectives defined in section @sec-design will be evaluated using the OHDSI R package `CohortDiagnostics` [@cd]. This package produces metrics such as cohort counts in the database, incidence rates (by calendar year, age and gender), time distributions, cohort attrition and breakdown of index events. Evaluation of these metrics helps ensure that the clinical cohort is indeed reliable in capturing HMB in the OMOP database.

## Stratification

Each target cohort will be analyzed in full and stratified on the following pre-index / at-index characteristics pending meeting a minimum reportable cell count of greater than 10 persons.

-   Depression (0 to 183 days prior to index date)
-   Anxiety (0 to 183 days prior to index date)
-   Combined Mood Disorder (Depression and Anxiety) (0 to 183 days prior to index date)
-   Benzodiazepines (0 to 183 days prior to index date)
-   Organic Sleep (0 to 183 days prior to index date)
-   Sleep Disturbances (at index date)
-   VMS (at index date)
-   iVMS (at index date)
-   Age at index date:
    -   Between 18 and 39
    -   Between 40 and 49
    -   Between 50 and 59
    -   Between 60 and 65

## Baseline Characteristics {#sec-baseline}

We assess baseline characteristics based on an observation window of 365 to 1 days prior to the index date , unless specified otherwise. Categorical covariates are reported as counts and percentages. Continuous covariates are reported as median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentile), minimum and maximum.

**Demographics**

-   Age on index date as 5-year categories
-   Age on index date as continuous
-   Race (if available)

**Concept-based**

For analysis on data converted to the OMOP CDM, covariates can be assessed based on either singular standardized concepts from the OMOP Vocabulary or by bundling multiple concepts through cohort definitions. A concept-based covariate describes the occurrence of an event based on the presence of a standardized code in the OMOP CDM. For conditions, standardized concepts are based on Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Vocabulary (SNOMED) and its hierarchy; including descendant concepts that are linked to the top-level term. For drugs, standardized concepts are based on the RxNorm vocabulary, where the hierarchy is rolled up to classes of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) vocabulary. Assessing concept-based covariates, in an OMOP analysis, is a general approach to assessing the clinical features of a population because it considers a very large set of features with minimal user specification.

-   Drug Era individual and rolled up to ATC2 Categories
-   Condition Era individual and rolled up to ICD10 Chapters

**Note**: Concept-based covariates are based on prevalence concepts accumulated via `FeatureExtraction` [@fe].

**Cohort-based**

Cohort-based covariates, in an OMOP analysis, are more specific definitions of clinical concepts of interest that are built using multiple concepts from the OMOP standardized vocabulary. Cohort-based covariates are used in the context of this study to specifically identify conditions of interest, determined prior to the study execution, that are not sufficiently identified via single concepts in the OMOP vocabulary.

-   Alopecia
-   Anxiety
-   Breast cancer
-   Cancer (excluding skin cancers)
-   Bipolar Disorder
-   Depression without bipolar
-   Gynecological cancers
-   Hypertension
-   Hyperthyroidism
-   Hypothyroidism
-   Malaise or fatigue
-   Myocardial Infarction
-   Osteoarthritis
-   Osteoporosis
-   Type 2 Diabetes
-   Stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic
-   Venous thromboembolism

## Post-Index Characteristics {#sec-postIndex}

Specific drug classes and procedures that are prescribed post-index will be described. Exposure to selected medications under the following categories will be observed across multiple time windows: 0 to 183 days, 184 to 365 days, 366 to 730 days, and 731 to 1825 days from index date. The drug classes are:

-   Antidepressants (including selected SSRIs/SNRIs)
-   Anticonvulsants (including gabapentin and pregabalin)
-   Anti-hypertensives (including clonidine)
-   Hormonal Therapy
-   Sedative hypnotics (including benzodiazepines)

## Treatment Patterns {#sec-TxPat}

An objective of this study is to characterize treatment pathways and the duration of use of different prescription medications used for symptoms of menopause. Therefore, the outcomes of the study are the description of the ordered sequence of treatments and the time to discontinuation of each treatment in that sequence. Further, the treatment patterns are stratified by calendar year. Treatment patterns are constructed first based on prescriptions per class (listed in section @exposure), then per specific ingredients of each class.

The ingredients of interest are:

-   Amitriptyline
-   Benzodiazepines
-   Citalopram
-   Clonidine
-   Escitalopram
-   Estrogens
-   Estrogens Combinations
-   Fluoxetine
-   Gabapentin
-   Paroxetine
-   Pregabalin
-   Progestogens
-   Progestogens & Estrogens
-   Raloxifene
-   Sertraline
-   Venlafaxine

For the four cohorts, treatment pathways composed of the treatments of interest (defined in section 9.3.1) prescribed to manage symptoms of menopause are identified. A treatment pathway is the sequence of treatments starting from the index date and ending at the end of the study period (section 9.2.2). When defining treatment pathways, the term era is used to refer to the span of time a woman is considered "exposed" to a treatment of interest. An era is constructed based on rules that combine successive periods of drug exposure into a continuous period. The minimum era duration determines the minimum duration for an era to be considered in the study; for this study there is no minimum era duration. The maximum time interval between two subsequent eras of the same treatments to collapse into the same era is 30 days (shown as eraCollapseSize in Figure 8). This means that if there is a gap greater than 30 days between the same treatment, this would indicate two separate eras in the pathway. A treatment combination is defined as an interval when a patient has two treatment eras overlapping in time. The minimum overlap time required between multiple treatments to be considered a combination is 30 days (shown as combinationWindow in Figure 8). The minimum time that a treatment era (before or after a combination of treatments) must last in order to be included as a separate treatment in the pathways is 30 days (shown as minPostCombinationDuration in Figure 8). This means that if treatment is observed for less than 30 days before or after a combination it is not considered as part of the sequence. Finally, only treatment changes are reported in the path, meaning we remove repeated treatments in the pathway and only report when a change occurs (shown as filterTreatments in Figure 8). The basis of our treatment sequence definition comes from Markus et al (32).

![Figure 8: Treatment Patterns Design](images/tx_design.png)

In addition to enumerating treatment pathways, the study is also interested in estimating the duration (in days) that a woman is continuously prescribed a particular treatment (or conversely the time until they stop the treatment). This duration is determined by the length of time for a particular treatment era. Discontinuation of a treatment is identified as a switch to a different drug or the woman has turned 65 years old. Any gap more than 30 days would be considered treatment discontinuation. An observation is censored if a switch is not determined based on end of continuous observation or end of the study period. As a part of a sensitivity analysis, a gap of 60 days will be considered for treatment discontinuation.

### Treatment Pathways {#sec-txSeq}

In addition to characterizations of patients, treatment patterns of all the target cohorts of the primary and exploratory objectives will be assessed. First, the unique pathways in the study population will be counted and visualized using Sankey diagrams. Pathways with at least 30 patients will only be considered in the analysis. Treatment pathways from the index date for the four target cohorts defined in section @sec-design will be constructed. In addition to the Sankey diagrams, a table enumerating the number of unique sequences and describing the number of patients who received a different pattern as a first-, second-, or third-line treatment will be provided.

### Time to Discontinuation {#sec-ttd}

Following description of treatment patterns, the analysis will continue by describing the time to treatment discontinuation. For this portion of the analysis, the median time to discontinuation will be described by calculating the survival curve using Kaplan-Meier plots along with two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Also, the probability of survival and confidence interval will be calculated for continuing treatment at 6 months, 1 year, and 2-year intervals. Time to discontinuation will also be stratified by calendar year.

## Incidence Analysis

For the target cohorts of the primary objective, the incidence rate (per 1,000 person years) of symptomatic events of menopause, described in section @sec-outcomes will be calculated. The purpose of the incidence analysis of subsequent symptoms of menopause is to contextualize utilization of treatments for menopause post index in the same periods of time. Incidence of these subsequent symptoms, following index menopausal diagnosis, may change the course of treatment for a woman seeking symptomatic relief of menopause. The time-at-risk for the symptomatic events are defined as 0-183, 184-365 and 366-730 and 731-1825 past the cohort index start date, which are the same as the utilization windows to provide context to potential shifts in prescription's due to symptoms. In addition, incidence analysis of the drug classes described in section @sec-exposure, and the ingredients described in section @sec-TxPat will be calculated for the same target cohorts and time windows as for the symptoms of menopause described above. The formula used to calculate the incidence rates is shown below:

$$
IR = \frac{\text{Number of new cases in time period}}{\text{Total person-time of the at risk population}} \times 1000
$$

The incidence will be calculated using the CohortIncidence package from HADES [@ci].
